PLT Scheme Simulation Collection

PLT Scheme Simulation Collection
Version 1.0
 
  The PLT Scheme Simulation Collection implements a combined discrete-event and
continuous simulation engine for developing simulation models in PLT Scheme.  The
simulation engine:
 
    * Provides a process-based simulation engine
    * Provides combined discrete-event and continuous simulation models
    * Provides automatic data collection
 
The source code is distributed with the simulation collection and is licensed under
the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL).
 
  The motivation behind the PLT Scheme Simulation Collection is to provide the
simulation engine for developing knowledge-based simulations in PLT Scheme.  It
is based on work originally done in Symbolics Common Lisp.  This is not as much a
port of the earlier work as a complete re-engineering of the system into PLT
Scheme.  In particular, it makes extensive use of continuations to provide a
process-based approach to building simulation models.  It also adds support for
building continuous simulation models, which were not part of the original work.
 
  The PLT Scheme Simulation Collection provides the following functionality for 
building and executing simulation models:
 
    * Simulation Environments (Basic)
    * Simulation Control (Basic)
    * Events
    * Processes
    * Resources
    * Data Collection
    * Sets
    * Continuous Simulation Models
    * Simulation Classes
    * Simulation Control (Advanced)
    * Simulation Environments (Hierarchical)
 
  A complete reference manual for the PLT Scheme Simulation Collection is under 
development.  A draft copy can be obtained by contacting the author mailto:m.douglas.williams@saic.com.  For now, please look at the examples for guidance on using the
simulation collection.
