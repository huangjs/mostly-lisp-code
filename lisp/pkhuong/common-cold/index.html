<p>Writing dynamic webpages with continuations can save a lot of pain,
by letting the computer compile the inversion of control
away. Unfortunately, continuations can rarely be exported outside the
language implementation's runtime, so we are usually forced to save
them at the server, and only pass a handle to the client. Not only may
this open the server up to DOS attacks, but it also usually means that
URLs have a finite, and relatively short, lifetime.</p>

<p id='overview'>Common Cold (CC)'s continuations are serialisable,
avoiding these problems and much of the complexity associated with
them. Moreover, instead of attempting to 'hide' the fact that we do
not use native continuations, I tried to make the transformation as
explicit as possible (by having the package use its own special forms
instead of a codewalker), but still usable (by using its
own <emph>special</emph> forms). The programmer can thus easily
control where the transformation will be made, and completely avoid
any overhead in sections of code that will never be captured. Since
the borders between the vanilla CL world and that of transformed code
are kept explicit, the danger of being surprised by a leaky
abstraction, e.g. when mixing continuations and native higher-order
functions, should be much lesser.</p>

<p id='capture'>CC supports both lexical bindings (static scoping) and
special variables (dynamic scoping). Serialised closures or
continuations always create fresh copies of the lexical scopes in the
state they were when the closure or the continuation frame was
created. Assigning to lexically bound variables can result in
surprising behaviour, especially since closures/continuations that
have not been deserialised have normal CL lexical bindings. Again, in
the interest of explicitness, nothing is done to prevent this from
happening; the programmer may very well know that a given variable is
only assigned to before capturing its scope. Note that side-effecting
lexically bound variables in continuations-based web framework is
often a cause of weird bugs, since it can be difficult to know when
bindings must be shared, and when they must be copied. Special
variables are the prime way to introduce mutable bindings in
CC. Specials created in CL code or via CC's own special forms can be
mixed transparently, but only CC's special forms will capture them in
continuations. Dynamic bindings are never shared between
continuations, and are recaptured every time a continuation is
captured. Assignments to special variables are thus carried from a
continuation's invocation to the next.</p>

<p id='specials'>Specials are also treated specially by the web
serving code. While the bindings are always saved in the
continuations, the topmost (non shadowed) ones are also exposed as CGI
parameters (as their qualified, URL-encoded, <code>SYMBOL-NAME</code>)
to the continuation's URL (this part may be buggy
with <code>GET</code> forms?). When a continuation is invoked (a
response is sent to the server), the topmost special bindings are
replaced (as if by assignment) by the rightmost parameter with the
corresponding name, if any. Parameters can thus simply be special
variables (I should create a special package for them to avoid their
being qualified), which will be side-effected with their value in the
form if any. Since CC uses Hunchentoot, it is of course also possible
to use Hunchentoot's functions for better access to parameters or
control of the headers.</p>

<p id='special-forms'>Lexical bindings may be created
 via <code>bind</code>, <code>mlet*</code> or <code>mlet</code> (if
 the computed values may capture the continuations;
 otherwise, <code>let</code> and <code>let*</code> are fine). Local
 functions should be bound normally, using <code>flet</code>
 and <code>labels</code>. Special variables may be introduced
 with <code>dbind</code>, <code>mdlet*</code> or <code>mdlet</code>
 (if no continuation will be captured in their dynamic scope, normal
 CL special forms will also work). Finally, <code>mprogn</code>
 introduces sequencing (when one of the forms may capture its
 continuation), <code>mcatch</code> a <code>catch</code> frame (that
 interacts with CL's <code>catch</code> and <code>throw</code>
 correctly, but is captured in continuations),
 and <code>mblock</code>, <code>mreturn-from</code>
 and <code>mreturn</code> (which may not always interact correctly
 with CL's <code>block</code>/<code>return-from</code>).</p>

<p id='continuations'>Page creating functions simply return a string,
 and may use Hunchentoot's functions freely. To use
 continuations, <code>call-with-&#x200B;continuation-&#x200B;url</code>
 or
 <code>send/suspend</code> may be
 used. <code>(call-with-&#x200B;continuation-&#x200B;url
 [argument-&#x200B;function])</code> unwinds the stack (thus making it
 closer to shift), builds a copy of the continuation's dynamic scope
 environment, and calls its argument function, passing it the URL
 representing its continuation. The argument function should return a
 string, the web page's contents. <code>(send/suspend ([k])
 [body])</code> builds on top
 of <code>call-with-&#x200B;continuation-&#x200B;url</code> and
 executes <code>[body]</code> with <code>[k]</code> bound to the URL
 representing <code>send/suspend</code>'s continuation. The body
 should evaluate to the response page's contents. In both cases, only
 a copy of the dynamic bindings is restored. Side effects, even to
 special variables, will not be reflected in the captured
 continuations, and <code>mcatch</code>s, <code>mblock</code>s,
 etc. are not active.</p>

<p id='misc'>The continuation part of URLs are encrypted using AES
 when a secret key has been registered
 using <code>register-key</code>. Registering a zero-length key
 disables the encryption (which is disabled by default). Continuations
 are then base64 (adapted to URIs) encodings of unencrypted gziped
 strings.</p>

<p><code>ensure-all-builders</code> may be called at any time to
compile all fragment (closures or continuation frames) deserialising
functions. In would then be possible to export the data to other nodes
for easier load balancing.</p>

<p>Finally, <code>make-continuation-&#x200B;handler</code> should be
used to create a dispatch function for Hunchentoot. The example should
make its usage clear.</p>

  <li><a href="closures.lisp">serialisable closures</a>

    <p>The user should mostly be interested in <code>slambda</code> and
    <code>sfunction</code>, special forms that are, respectively,
    like <code>lambda</code> and <code>function</code>, but return
    closures that can be serialised (printed readably).</p>
  </li>
  <li><a href="continuations.lisp">serialisable continuations</a>

    <p>Exports symbols related to dynamic-binding and catch frames, and
    the macros for the continuations mini
    language. <code>invoke-cont</code> may be interesting to someone
    building something else.</p>
  </li>
  <li><a href="handler.lisp">handler for hunchentoot</a>

    <p>Fills the COMMON-COLD package, which is the only one that should
    be USEd by the user. Defines <code>ensure-all-builders</code>, all
