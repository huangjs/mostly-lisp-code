2006-09-10: I'm using Span for a continuations-based webserver (that
speaks mod_lisp). The green threading support depends on sbcl's
unix-layer, so isn't portable, but should be easily ported ;) The
server code is in server/, and depends on sbcl's bsd-sockets and on
ironclad (asdf-installable).  The example page depends on Edi Weitz's
CL-WHO. The code is highly experimental, and some things are downright
wrong, like the send-string function, which doesn't take SSIZE_MAX
into account.

New: A binary distribution for linux/x86. This is simply a bzipped
executable clisp image. Download it <a href='span-nli-bin.bz2'>here</a>.
No guarantee, don't blame me if it messes up your computer, etc.

In short, Span/NLI is a set of portable extensions to Common Lisp
written in Common Lisp.  I'm not really interested in hacking the
type system (for that, see Qi), but in making it a bit easier to use,
especially for someone coming from an Unix perspective. In order to 
achieve that, we have: syntactic sugar to abbreviate let, let*, flet,
labels, setf and lambda, support for easier manipulation of functions
(binding values directly to lexical functions, dynamically-scoped 
functions and calling the result of an arbitrary expression without an
explicit funcall), and call/cc, on top of which cooperative multitasking 
is implemented. All that is in portable Common Lisp and compiles to
portable CL.
