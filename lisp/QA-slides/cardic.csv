"Wide splitting","associated with pulmonic stenosis, or right branch block, seen in delay RV emptying= delayed pulmonic sound, "
"Paradoxical splitting ","associated with aortic stenosis or left bundle branch block  ( Expiration= wide, inspiration= smaller), delay LV emptying= P2 sound occurs before A2 sound. On inspiration, later P2 and earlier A2 move closer to one another.  "

"2nd degree Mobitz type I (Wenckebach)","Progressive lengthening of the PR interval until a beat is “dropped” (a P wave not followed by a QRS complex). Usually asymptomatic."
"Mobitz type II","Dropped beats that are not preceded by a change in the length of the PR interval (as in type I). These abrupt, nonconducted P waves result in a pathologic condition. It is often found as 2:1 block, where there are 2 P waves to 1 QRS response. May progress to 3rd- degree block."
"3rd degree (complete)","The atria and ventricles beat independently of each other. Both P waves and QRS complexes are present, although the P waves bear no relation to the QRS complexes. The atrial rate is faster than the ventricular rate. Usually treat with pacemaker."
"Ventricular fibrillation","A completely erratic rhythm with no identifiable waves. Fatal arrhythmia without immediate CPR and defibrillation."

"Chemoreceptors:","1. Peripheral—carotid and aortic bodies respond to ↓ PO2 (< 60 mmHg), ↑ PCO2, and ↓ pH of blood."
,"2. Central—respond to changes in pH and PCO2 of brain interstitial fluid, which in turn are influenced by arterial CO2. Do not directly respond to PO2. Responsible for Cushing reaction— ↑ intracranial pressure constricts arterioles → cerebral ischemia → hypertension (sympathetic response) and reflex bradycardia. Note: Cushing triad = hypertension, bradycardia, respiratory depression."
