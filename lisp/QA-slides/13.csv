"T- and B-cell activation","2 signals are required for T-cell activation and B-cell class switching––signal 1 and signal 2.
Th activation:
1. Foreign body is phagocytosed by APC
2. Foreign antigen is presented on MHC II and
recognized by TCR on Th cell (signal 1)
3. “Costimulatory signal” is given by interaction
of B7 and CD28 (signal 2)
4. Th cell activated to produce cytokines
Tc activation:
1. Endogenously synthesized (viral or self)
proteins are presented on MHC I and
recognized by TCR on Tc cell (signal 1)
2. IL-2 from Th cell activates Tc cell to kill
virus-infected cell (signal 2)      B-cell class switching: 1. IL-4,IL-5 or IL-6 from Th2 cell (signal 1)  2. CD 40 receptor activation by binding         CD 40 ligand on Th cell (signal 2)"
