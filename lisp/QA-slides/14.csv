"IMMUNOLOGY—IMMUNE RESPONSES",
"IL-1","Secreted by macrophages. Causes acute inflammation. Induces chemokine production to recruit leukocytes; activates endothelium to express adhesion molecules. An endogenous pyrogen.           “Hot T-Bone stEAk”: IL-1: fever (hot)  IL-2: stimulates T cells. IL-3: stimulates bone marrow. IL-4: stimulates IgE production. IL-5: stimulates IgA production."
"IL-2","Secreted by Th cells. Stimulates growth of helper and cytotoxic T cells."
"IL-3","Secreted by activated T cells. Supports the growth
and differentiation of bone marrow stem cells. Has
a function similar to GM-CSF."
"IL-4","Secreted by Th2 cells. Promotes growth of B cells.
Enhances class switching to IgE and IgG."
"IL-5","Secreted by Th2 cells. Promotes differentiation of B
cells. Enhances class switching to IgA. Stimulates
production and activation of eosinophils."
"IL-6","Secreted by Th cells and macrophages. Stimulates
production of acute-phase reactants and
Immunoglobulins."
"IL-8","Secreted by macrophages. Major chemotactic factor for neutrophils.    “Clean up on aisle 8.” Neutrophils are recruited by IL-8 to clear infections."
"IL-10","Secreted by regulatory T cells. Inhibits actions of activated T cells."
"IL-12","Secreted by B cells and macrophages. Activates NK
and Th1 cells."
"Γ-interferon","Secreted by Th1 cells. Stimulates macrophages."
"TNF","Secreted by macrophages. Mediates septic shock.
Causes leukocyte recruitment, vascular leak."
"Active immunity","Induced after exposure to foreign antigens. Slow  onset. Long-lasting protection (memory).        After exposure to Tetanus toxin,Botulinum toxin, HBV, or Rabies, patients are given preformed antibodies (passive)––To Be Healed Rapidly."
"Passive  immunity","Based on receiving preformed antibodies from another host. Rapid onset. Short life span of antibodies (half-life = 3 weeks)."
"Antigen variation","Classic examples: Bacteria––Salmonella (2 flagellar variants),Borrelia (relapsing fever), Neisseria gonorrhoeae (pilus protein). Virus––influenza (major = shift, minor = drift).
Parasites––trypanosomes (programmed
Rearrangement).     Some mechanisms for variation include DNA rearrangement and RNA segment reassortment (e.g., influenza major shift)."
"Anergy","Self-reactive T cells become nonreactive without costimulatory molecule.
B cells also become anergic, but tolerance is less complete than in T cells."
