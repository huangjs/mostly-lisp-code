"Disease","Defect","Presentation","Labs"
"Bruton's agammaglobulinemia","X-linked recessive ( ↑ in Boys), Defect in BTK, a tyrosine kinase gene---->blocks B-cell differentiation/ maturation.","Recurrent bacterial infections after 6 months (↓maternal lgG) due to opsonization defect.","Normal pro-B,↓maturation,↓number of B cells, ↓immunoglobulins of all classes."
"Hyper-lgM syndrome","Defective CD40L on heper T cells = inability to class switch.","Servere pyogenic infections early in life","↑lgM;↓↓lgG,lgA,lgE"
"Selective lg deficiency ","Defect in isotype     switching-->deficiency in specific class of immunoglobulins.","sinus and lung infections,milk allergies and diarrhea, Anaphylaxis on exposure to blood products with lgA.","LgA deficiency most common. Failure to mature into plasma cells. ↓secretory lgA."
"Common variable immunodeficiency (CVID)","Defect in B-cell maturation;many causes.","Can be acquired in 20s-30s; ↑risk of autoimmune disease, lymphoma,sinopulmonary infections.","Normal number of B-cells;↓plasma cells,↓plasma cells, immunoglobulin."
"Thymic aplasia (DiGeorge syndrome","22q 11 deletion; failure to develop 3rd and 4th pharyngeal pouches.","Tetany(hypocalcemia), recurrent viral/ fungal infections (T-cell deficiency), congenital heart and great vessel defects.","Thymus and parathyroids fail to develop -->↓T cells,↓PTH,↓Ca2+,A"
