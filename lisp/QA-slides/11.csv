"IMMUNOLOGY—LYMPHOID STRUCTURES",
"Lymph node","A 2° lymphoid organ that has many afferents, 1 or more efferents. Encapsulated, with
trabeculae. Functions are nonspecific filtration by macrophages, storage and
activation of B and T cells, antibody production."
"Follicle","Site of B-cell localization and
proliferation. In outer cortex.
1° follicles are dense and
dormant. 2° follicles have
pale central germinal
centers and are active."
"Medulla","Consists of medullary cords
(closely packed lymphocytes
and plasma cells) and
medullary sinuses.
Medullary sinuses
communicate with efferent
lymphatics and contain
reticular cells and macrophages."
"Paracortex","Houses T cells. Region of cortex between follicles and medulla. Contains high endothelial venules through which T and B cells enter from blood. In an extreme cellular immune response,
paracortex becomes greatly enlarged. Not well
developed in patients with DiGeorge syndrome. "
